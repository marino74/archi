    documentation="This &quot;Aggregates&quot; is used that the information described by an Entity in a Aggregate is actually managed in a different aggregate. For example, the Aggregate Customer constains the Entity &quot;Contact Point&quot;, this means that the contact points are relevant in the context of the customer and makes sense to be retrieved from to the &quot;customer&quot; aggregate (for example, through the APIs that exposes the customer aggregate). However the contact points are managed in a separate Aggregate because it is information also relevant for other aggregates, such as the &quot;customer communications&quot;">
