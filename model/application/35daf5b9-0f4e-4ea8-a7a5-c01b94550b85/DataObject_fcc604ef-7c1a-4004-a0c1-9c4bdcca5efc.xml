    documentation="A Value Object models an immutable conceptual whole. Within the model the Value is just that, a value. Unlike an Entity , it does not have a unique identity, and equivalence is determined by comparing the attributes encapsulated by the Valuetype. Furthermore, a Value Object is not a thing but is often used to describe, quantify, or measure an Entity&#xA;&#xA;For example, the Customer Position is a value object in the &quot;Customer&quot; Aggregate. A customer positions does not make sense it they are not in the context of a Customer and do not have a proper &quot;identity&quot; or lifecycle. This is the reason why itÂ´s considered a value object and not an Entity. &#xA;&#xA;the difference of value objects and entities do not have any special impact in the actual implementation of the software managing such components">
